### Demo showcasing how to automate your training ML models on Github actions and use DVC for data versioning

### Try it out yourself

1. Fork this repo

2. Checkout a branch and test out a different ML model via `git checkout -b random_forest` 
3. Add ML classifier of your choice to `titanic_model/pipeline.py`

5. Go get a sip of ☕ while your model trains
Once traininig is completed it should look like this

### To run it locally follow below instructions

#### Pre-requisites

- Python 3
- Conda [Optional, but recommended]

1. If you have conda, than install `pipenv` via `conda install pipenv`, if you don't just do `pip install pipenv`
2. To install dependencies do `pipenv install`
3. To activate virtual environment do `pipenv shell`
4. Run Jupyter Notebook by `jupyter notebook` command
5. Run `tox` to train ML model and generated reports and pipeline is saved in `titanic_model/trained_model_artifacts`
